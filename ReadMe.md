## User Stories

1. **Homepage Layout**  
   As a Front-End Developer, I will implement a homepage that presents the To-Do List with a clean HTML and CSS structure, using Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern, consistent look across all devices.

2. **Task Creation Modal**  
   I will create a modal to add new tasks, including fields for the title, description, status (To Do, Doing, Done), due date, and priority (P1, P2, P3). Each task will display its priority visually, with styles adjusting automatically.

3. **Task Display**  
   I will display tasks in an organized list format, with each task showing its title, due date, and visual priority: P1 (Red), P2 (Orange), and P3 (Green).

4. **Status Update**  
   As a user, I want to change the status of individual tasks as needed.

5. **Statistics Overview**  
   Users will be able to view statistics, including the count of different tasks.

6. **Task Deletion**  
   I will integrate functionality to delete tasks, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the app.

7. **Form Validation**  
   Forms will include validation to ensure data quality, with checks for input integrity before adding tasks.

8. **Dynamic & Interactive UI**  
   Using JavaScript, I will create a dynamic, interactive experience with animations for task additions and deletions.

9. **Accessibility**  
   I will ensure accessibility by meeting contrast standards and adding labels to form elements, making the app usable for individuals with special needs.

10. **Project Deployment**  
    I will deploy the project online via GitHub Pages or Vercel, allowing access for all users and testing across devices and browsers.

## Bonus Features

1. **Batch Task Creation**  
   Implement a modal allowing users to add multiple tasks with a “+” button to add additional fields.

2. **Drag and Drop Status Update**  
   Enable users to change task status using drag-and-drop functionality.

3. **Persistent Data**  
   Use LocalStorage to retain task modifications after page refresh or site exit.

4. **Task Editing**  
   Add functionality to modify existing tasks, making the app more adaptable and useful.

5. **Sorting and Filtering**  
   Include options to sort tasks by due date and filter by priority (P1, P2, P3) for easier task management.

6. **Search Functionality**  
   Allow users to quickly find specific tasks by title or keyword.

7. **Automatic Sorting**  
   Implement an algorithm to auto-sort tasks by due date or priority to facilitate chronological task management.
